# NAME

Test2::Plugin::UUID - Use REAL UUIDs in Test2

# DESCRIPTION

Test2 normally uses unique IDs generated by appending pid, thread-id, and an
incrementing integer. These work fine most of the time, but are not sufficient
if you want to keep a database of events, in that case a real UUID is much more
useful.

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Plugin::UUID;

This is also useful at the command line for 1-time use:

    $ perl -MTest2::Plugin::UUID path/to/test.t
